### **Security & Considerations**

1. **Password Security** : Use secure password hashing (e.g., bcrypt) for storing passwords.
2. **Role-based Access Control** : Ensure that only users with the appropriate roles (Admin, Organizer, User) can access their respective functionalities.
3. **Data Validation** : Validate all inputs on both the client and server-side to prevent malicious input (SQL injection, XSS).
4. **Payment Integration** : Use secure payment gateways like PayPal or Stripe, ensuring PCI-DSS compliance.
5. **Notifications** : Integrate email or SMS notifications to notify users about registration confirmation, event reminders, and feedback requests.

### **Inventory Management System**

---

### **1. Entity Design**

Here are the updated entities and their relationships:

* **User** : Manages login and role-based access control (Admin, Sales, Warehouse, Supplier).
* **Product** : Represents items in the inventory, including product details like price, quantity, SKU, etc.
* **Supplier** : Manages the details of suppliers for replenishing stock.
* **Category** : Categorizes products for better organization (e.g., Electronics, Furniture).
* **Order** : Represents customer orders, tracking which products were ordered and their status.
* **Transaction** : Represents inventory movements such as stock purchases, sales, returns, or adjustments.
* **Warehouse** : Represents different warehouse locations where products are stored.
* **Inventory** : Tracks the stock of products within specific warehouses.
* **Shipping** : Tracks shipment details for outgoing orders.
* **Return** : Handles product returns and updates inventory accordingly.
* **Pricing** : Represents pricing adjustments, discounts, and promotional pricing.

### **3. Relationships Between Entities**

* **One-to-Many** :
* A **user** can place multiple  **orders** .
* A **category** can have multiple  **products** .
* A **supplier** can supply multiple  **products** .
* A **warehouse** can store multiple **products** (through the **inventory** table).
* **Many-to-Many** :
* A **product** can appear in many  **orders** , and an **order** can have many **products** (this is handled by the **order_items** table, which is not explicitly shown here but would be created as an intermediate table).
* **One-to-One** :
* An **order** has one **shipping** record.
* A **return** can only relate to a single **order** and  **product** .

### **4. Conclusion**

This extended **Inventory Management System** (IMS) design includes all the necessary entities and relationships to handle a full range of

operations, from product management, inventory tracking, order handling, to shipping and returns. By breaking down the operations into modular entities, this design ensures scalability, flexibility, and a structured approach to managing inventory.
